# ðŸ“Š AWS Daily Cost Report Automation

This repository contains the complete source code for the blog series  
**[Daily Automated AWS Cost Reports by Email](https://devopsbug.com)** on [devopsbug.com](https://devopsbug.com).

The project demonstrates how to:

- Develop and test AWS Lambda functions locally using **SAM CLI**
- Query the AWS **Cost Explorer API** to retrieve daily cost data by service
- Send cost reports via **SNS Email**
- Automate daily execution using **Amazon EventBridge**

## ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s Inside

This project uses the **AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)** framework and is organized as follows:

```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ sam-cost-report/ # Source code for the AWS Lambda function
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ app.py # Lambda handler that queries AWS Cost Explorer
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ template.yaml # SAM template defining resources (Lambda, SNS, EventBridge)
â””â”€â”€ README.md # You are here
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

To deploy the application using SAM CLI:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DevOpsBug/AWS_DailyCostReport.git
cd AWS_DailyCostReport

# 2. Build the SAM application
sam build

# 3. Deploy (youâ€™ll be prompted for parameters)
sam deploy --guided
```

Make sure your AWS credentials are properly configured (~/.aws/credentials) and you have sufficient permissions to deploy Lambda, SNS, and EventBridge resources.

## ðŸ“¬ Output
Once deployed, you will receive daily emails at 8 PM (UTC) containing a breakdown of your AWS service costs for the current day.
